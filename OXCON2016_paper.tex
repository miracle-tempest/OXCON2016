\begin{abstract}
Since the Agricultural Revolution, storytelling
has evolved from a means to caution future
generations into a ideal medium to reveal
humanity's most primal fears and desires;
stories discussing the essence of humanity,
the inevitability of mortality, humankind's
relationship with nature, and the role of the
divine appear throughout history. From the
\emph{Epic of Gilgamesh} to \emph{Doctor Who}
and \emph{Forbidden Planet}, many of humanity's
most enduring stories are built on the same
fundamental patterns. Analyzing these
cross-cultural, cross-generational motifs
through the lens of modern science fiction
reveals powerful commentary on the nature of
humanity. Like Gilgamesh, \emph{Doctor Who}
never was about the Doctor.

\section{Introduction}
%
%Archetypes are pancultural, pangenerational manifestations of the collective unconcious.
%

\section{Background}
\subsection{The \emph{Epic of Gilgamesh}}
%
%Introduction to Mesopotamia and the \emph{Epic of Gilgamesh}
%The Fertile Crscent is the craddle of civilization, oldest civilization in the world. The \emph{Epic of GIlgamesh} is the oldest known work of Western fiction. It stands out because it is a narrative, a long poem, when all other works at the time were inventories/financial transactions. It was written in cuneiform. Some of the tablets are missing. Storytelling originated in Mesopotamia alongside the written word. Discusses themes relevent even today.
%
%Gilgamesh is the fifth king of Uruk after the great flood. He built the city's walls. He's two thirds god and one third human. He is the greatest warrior ever to live, but he oppressed his people, etc.. It is the story of Gilgamesh andEnkidu becoming human together.
%

\subsection{\emph{Doctor Who}}
%
%Introduction to modern science fiction and \emph{Doctor Who}
%Science fiction is by nature an experimental genre. It allows its creators to challenge social mores, discussing many ancient themes. 
%
%\emph{Doctor Who} is a long-running BBC television program about a functionally immortal Time Lord who travels through time and space fighting monsters and learning to be human with the help of his companions. The Doctor was forced to ommit genocide in order to end the Time War.
%

\section{Comparative Archetypes}
\subsection{The Hero's Journey}
%
%Out of normalcy and into the realm of the supernatural, wherein they must fight monsters/overcome impossible odds before returning with a bounty, home.
%

\subsection{The Wild Man}
%
%Ran with the animals, drank from their streams, introduced to society, rejected by the animals. 
%

\subsection{Femininity and Misogyny}
\subsubsection{The Wise Woman}
%
%TARDIS=Ninsum
%

\subsubsection{The Seductress}
%
%Missy=Prostitute (Not sectualized, but distracted the Doctor from his goal)
%

\subsubsection{The Beloved}
%
%Riverâ‰ Anyone in the \emph{Epic of Gilgamesh}, because it's mysogynistic
%

\subsection{Immortality and the Afterlfie}
%
%Regenration isn't permenant, just as the snake eats the flower. The afterlife is a physical place, but you cannot thwart it.
%

\section{Analysis}
%
%The Doctor and Gilgamesh are both given ultimate power, but are ultimately not qualified to weild it.
%
%Fatal flaw=hubris
%

\section{Summary and Conclusion}
%
%Relevence restated
