\begin{abstract}
Since the Agricultural Revolution, storytelling has evolved from a means to
caution future generations into a ideal medium to reveal humanity's most
primal fears and desires; stories discussing the essence of humanity, the
inevitability of mortality, humankind's relationship with nature, and the
role of the divine appear throughout history. From the \emph{Epic of
Gilgamesh} to \emph{Doctor Who} and \emph{Forbidden Planet}, many of
humanity's most enduring stories are built on the same fundamental
patterns. Analyzing these cross-cultural, cross-generational motifs through
the lens of modern science fiction reveals powerful commentary on the
nature of humanity. Like Gilgamesh, \emph{Doctor Who} never was about The
Doctor.
